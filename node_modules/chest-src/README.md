> Dynamic **require** in the browser and a few other lightweight tools...

## Getting Started

In conjuction with  [grunt-chest-compiler](https://github.com/quirinpa/grunt-chest-compiler), this tool allows you to use [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)'s style of **require** calls on the **browser** side (along with module.**exports**), and it loads "required" modules automatically and asynchronously. It stores dependencies in localStorage so you might have to clear it every once in a while, for that reason and more this is still an experimental tool.

It also ships with a few small default modules: *extend*, *jmap* and *zipcookie*.

Here is an example of *inheritance* and *inclusion* you can probably identify with:

```js
var extend = require('extend');

function mammel(name, age){
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}
mammel.prototype = {
  talk: function(){
    return ': hello, my name is ' + this.name + ', i\'m ' + this.age + '.';
  }
};

function dog(name, age){
  super(name, age);
}
dog.prototype.talk = function(a){
  return 'barkeese' + super.talk(a);
};

extend(dog, mammel);

var bob = new dog('bob', 21);

console.log(bob.talk('hello'));

module.exports = dog;
```
